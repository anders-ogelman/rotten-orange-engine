# rotten-orange-engine
A game creation framework built on top of LOVE2D inspired by principles of functional programming and entity component systems. Currently being developed alongside a short game that I will release soon, which will serve as a proof of concept. 

This repo also contains assets and code for a demo level, contained within level1.lua in the code. To execute the demo level, dowload Love 11.4 from https://love2d.org/, and drag the entire rotten-orange-engine folder onto the executable love.exe.
